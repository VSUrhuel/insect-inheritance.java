## Die.java

The `Die.java` file contains the class definition for the `Die` object. This class represents a die with a certain number of sides. It includes properties such as the number of sides and provides a method to roll the die and get a random number.

## Fly.java

The `Fly.java` file contains the class definition for the `Fly` object. This class represents a fly insect. It inherits from the `Insect` class and adds specific behavior related to flying.

## Frog.java

The `Frog.java` file contains the class definition for the `Frog` object. This class represents a frog. It inherits from the `Insect` class and adds specific behavior related to frogs.

## Insect.java

The `Insect.java` file contains the class definition for the `Insect` object. This class represents a generic insect. It provides basic properties and methods that are common to all insects.

## Insect2.java

The `Insect2.java` file contains the class definition for the `Insect2` object. This class represents another type of insect. It inherits from the `Insect` class and adds additional behavior specific to this type of insect.

## Pond.java

The `Pond.java` file contains the class definition for the `Pond` object. This class represents a pond environment where insects and frogs can interact. It provides methods to add insects and frogs to the pond and simulate their behavior.
